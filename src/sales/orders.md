title: Orders
---

The Orders workspace lists all current orders, where each row in the grid represents an order and each column represents an attribute or data field. By default, orders are displayed in descending order from latest to earliest purchase date.

The [Status]({% link sales/order-status.md %}) column shows where the order is in the [workflow]({% link sales/order-workflow.md %}). The status of all sales orders begins as `Pending` and progresses through the workflow as the payment is processed, the order invoiced, and shipped.

Use the standard [controls]({% link stores/admin-grid-controls.md %}) to sort and filter the list, find orders, and apply [actions]({% link stores/admin-actions-control.md %}) to selected orders. The tabs above the pagination controls can be used to filter the list, change the default view, change and rearrange columns, and export data. The available actions are determined by where the order is in the workflow.

In the [Order workspace]({% link sales/orders-workspace.md %}), you can manage existing orders and create new orders. You can also [create a new order]({% link customers/customer-account-create-order.md %}) from the customer's account.
